Instead of picking a new Race on your next turn you activate your previous In Decline Race. You may keep the tokens that In Decline Race already had on the board, fl ipping them back to their Active side; or take them back in your hand if you like.

The number of tokens in each stack is adjusted each time you capture or lose a Swamp region. A Behemoth must always be accompanied by at least one Race token.

To perform a Zeppelined conquest, you choose a Region anywhere on the board (either on the Ground or in Sky Islands) and roll the Reinforcement Die. Pips on the Die are worth one Race token each. If you don\u2019t have enough Race tokens in hand to overcome the Defense value of the Region (you always need to place at least one Race token in the Region), your turn is over and you must redeploy any remaining tokens. If the roll is an empty side, the zeppelin crashes: the Defender discards one Race token for that attack and takes any others back in hand, exactly like a typical conquest. The Zeppelined player must also discard a Race token and doesn\u2019t occupy the Region. Place a Burning Region token in the Region instead.
