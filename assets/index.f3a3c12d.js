The Catapult may be used to attack a region beyond the Lake, but not over Seas. The region with the Catapult is immune to enemy conquests as well as their racial and special powers. The Catapult disappears when you go into Decline."},corrupt:{name:"CORRUPT",description:"Collect 1 bonus coin from any opponent each time they successfully conquer one of your active regions."},imperial:{name:"IMPERIAL",description:"For each region in excess of 3, which your Imperial troops occupy at the end of your turn, collect 1 bonus coin.

All tokens in this Region are taken in hand by the defeated player and treated as if the Region were conquered (except there is no loss of tokens).

At the beginning of your next turn, remove all Lava Tokens from the board and proceed as usual."},soul_Touch:{name:"SOUL-TOUCH",description:"When your Soul-Touch Race goes In Decline, it automatically revives your In-Decline Race. Instead of picking a new Race on your next turn you activate your previous In Decline Race. You may keep the tokens that In Decline Race already had on the board, fl ipping them back to their Active side; or take them back in your hand if you like. You get the rest (if any) of the Race tokens (and Markers, if any) you would receive if this was a new combo pick, and immediately play a full turn with them."},historian:{name:"HISTORIAN",description:"Collect 1 bonus Victory coin for each Race In Decline at the time you select the Historians.

These 2 stacks can never be split or mixed. Each Behemoths\u2019 stack counts as an equivalent number of Race tokens for attack AND defense. The number of tokens in each stack is adjusted each time you capture or lose a Swamp region. A Behemoth must always be accompanied by at least one Race token. If the region it occupies is conquered, only the accompanying Race token is lost; redeploy your Behemoth (keep it as a single stack) at the end of your attacker\u2019s turn, as normal."},fireball:{name:"FIREBALL",description:"During Troop Redeployment, collect 1 Fireball marker for each Magic Source you occupy.

A region can never be worth less than zero Victory coin."},zepplined:{name:"ZEPPLINED",description:"Your Zeppelin tokens can be used for up to fi ve special conquests per turn. To perform a Zeppelined conquest, you choose a Region anywhere on the board (either on the Ground or in Sky Islands) and roll the Reinforcement Die. Pips on the Die are worth one Race token each. If you don\u2019t have enough Race tokens in hand to overcome the Defense value of the Region (you always need to place at least one Race token in the Region), your turn is over and you must redeploy any remaining tokens. If the roll is an empty side, the zeppelin crashes: the Defender discards one Race token for that attack and takes any others back in hand, exactly like a typical conquest. The Zeppelined player must also discard a Race token and doesn\u2019t occupy the Region. Place a Burning Region token in the Region instead. It is immune to conquests and racial or special powers until the beginning of your next turn, when all the Burning Region tokens are removed from the board.

You cannot give more Trade Pacts than the amount of Victory coins you own though. If a player with Trade Pacts conquers at least one of your Haggling Race\u2019s Regions, he must give you one Victory coin per Trade Pact he has (if he doesn\u2019t have enough coins, he gives you everything he has). On the other hand, if a player with Trade Pacts doesn\u2019t conquer any Region from your Haggling Race, you must give him one Victory coin per Trade Pact he has.

During the following turns, each Cannon can either shoot (fl ip it to it\u2019s \u201CFire!\u201D side) or move to another of your Gunner Regions (inactive side up). Regions with a Cannon inside are immune to conquests and racial or special powers. A cannon with its \u201CFire!\u201D side up allows the conquest of adjacent Regions at a cost of two less Race tokens than normal.
